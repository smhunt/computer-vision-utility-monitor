    "notes": "The white odometer wheels clearly show '02271.3'. The small red pointer is positioned between the '0.04' and '0.05' marks on the circular dial. It appears to be approximately 3/10ths of the way past the '0.04' mark, leading to an interpolated dial value of 0.043 m\u00b3. The needle angle is calculated relative to 0 degrees at the 12 o'clock position (where the m\u00b3 label is), increasing clockwise. The 0.04 mark is at 180 degrees and the 0.05 mark is at 210 degrees; therefore, 0.043 corresponds to 180 + (0.3 * 30) = 189 degrees.",
