    "notes": "Odometer wheels read 02271 for whole cubic meters and 8 for the tenths place, resulting in 2271.8 m\u00b3. The red needle on the circular dial points past the 0.03 mark. There are 4 small ticks between 0.03 and 0.04, indicating each tick represents 0.002 m\u00b3. The needle is precisely on the second tick mark after 0.03, yielding a dial reading of 0.03 + (2 * 0.002) = 0.034 m\u00b3. The total reading is 2271.8 + 0.034 = 2271.834 m\u00b3. The needle angle is calculated assuming 0.00 is at 0 degrees (12 o'clock) and each 0.001 increment is 3.6 degrees, so 0.034 is 34 * 3.6 = 122.4 degrees.",
