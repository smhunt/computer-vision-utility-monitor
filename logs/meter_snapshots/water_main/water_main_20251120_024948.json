Black digit (single digit on right, separated): 2 = 0.2 m\u00b3. Red dial analysis: Dial orientation: '0' mark at top of dial, '5' mark at bottom of dial. Dial number scale position: pointing at approximately 2.5, Clock position: approximately 3 o'clock, Degrees: 90\u00b0 (pointing RIGHT), Verification: Hand is pointing RIGHT \u2713. Dial reading: 90/3600 = 0.025 m\u00b3. Total: 2271.225 m\u00b3. Note: Image quality is suboptimal with significant blur making precise digit and dial reading challenging, but overall meter reading appears to be in expected range for this meter.",
