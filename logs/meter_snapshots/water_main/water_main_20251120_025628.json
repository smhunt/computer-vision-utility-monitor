Black digit (single digit on right, separated): 1 = 0.1 m\u00b3. Red dial analysis: Dial orientation: '0' mark at top of dial, '5' mark at bottom of dial. Dial number scale position: pointing between 2 and 3, approximately at 2.5. Clock position: approximately 3 o'clock. Degrees: 90\u00b0 (pointing RIGHT). Verification: Hand is pointing RIGHT \u2713. Dial reading: 90/3600 = 0.025 m\u00b3. Total: 2271.125 m\u00b3. Note: Image is slightly blurry making precise black digit reading challenging, appears to be '1' but could potentially be '2'. Dial hand appears to point near 2.5 position (90 degrees).",
