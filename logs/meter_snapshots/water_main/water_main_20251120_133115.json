Black digit (single digit on right, separated): 4 = 0.4 m\u00b3. Red dial analysis: Dial orientation: '0' mark at top of dial, '5' mark at bottom of dial. Dial number scale position: pointing between 1 and 2, approximately at 1.4 on dial face. Clock position: approximately 1.5 o'clock. Degrees: 50\u00b0 (pointing UP-RIGHT between 12 and 3 o'clock). Verification: Hand is pointing UP-RIGHT \u2713. Dial reading: 50/3600 = 0.014 m\u00b3. Total: 2271.414 m\u00b3. Image is slightly blurry which makes precise dial reading challenging, but all digits are clearly visible.",
