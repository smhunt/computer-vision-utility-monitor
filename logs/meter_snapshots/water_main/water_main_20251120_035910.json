    "notes": "Odometer wheels read 2271.8. The red needle is pointing between the 0.05 and 0.06 marks. Visually, it is slightly past the halfway point between these two marks. Following the rule to interpolate to one decimal tick (0.01 resolution) and rounding to the nearest value, 0.06 is chosen. The angle is estimated based on the needle being approximately 60% of the way from 0.05 to 0.06.",
