Black digit (single digit on right, separated): 2 = 0.2 m\u00b3. Red dial analysis: Dial orientation: '0' mark at top of dial, '5' mark at bottom of dial. Dial number scale position: pointing at approximately 5.3 (slightly past 5), Clock position: approximately 6:20 o'clock, Degrees: 190\u00b0 (pointing DOWN-SLIGHTLY-LEFT), Verification: Hand is pointing DOWN past the 6 o'clock position \u2713. Dial reading: 190/3600 = 0.053 m\u00b3. Total: 2271.253 m\u00b3. Image is slightly out of focus which makes precise dial reading challenging, but white and black digits are clearly visible.",
