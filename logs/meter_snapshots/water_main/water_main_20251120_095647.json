Black digit (single digit on right, separated): 4 = 0.4 m\u00b3. Red dial analysis: Dial orientation: '0' mark at top of dial, '5' mark at bottom of dial. Dial number scale position: pointing at approximately 4.7 (between 4 and 5, very close to 5), Clock position: approximately 5:40 o'clock, Degrees: 170\u00b0 (pointing DOWN-RIGHT, slightly left of 6 o'clock), Verification: Hand is pointing DOWN-RIGHT \u2713. Dial reading: 170/3600 = 0.047 m\u00b3. Total: 2271.447 m\u00b3. Note: Image shows some blur/distortion which affects precision of dial reading. Black digit appears to be 4, though slight blur makes it somewhat difficult to confirm with absolute certainty.",
