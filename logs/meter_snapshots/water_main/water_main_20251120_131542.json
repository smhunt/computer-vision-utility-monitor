Black digit (single digit on right, separated): 2 = 0.2 m\u00b3. Red dial analysis: Dial orientation: '0' mark at top of dial, '5' mark at bottom of dial. Dial number scale position: pointing between 1 and 2, approximately at 1.4 on dial scale. Clock position: between 1 and 2 o'clock. Degrees: 50\u00b0 (pointing UP-RIGHT). Verification: Hand is pointing UP-RIGHT \u2713. Dial reading: 50/3600 = 0.014 m\u00b3. Total: 2271.214 m\u00b3. Note: Image quality is somewhat blurry making precise dial hand position difficult to determine with high confidence, but white and black digits are clearly readable.",
