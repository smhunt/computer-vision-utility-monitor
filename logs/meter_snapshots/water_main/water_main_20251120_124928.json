Black digit (single digit on right, separated): 4 = 0.4 m\u00b3. Red dial analysis: Dial orientation: '0' mark at top of dial, '5' mark at bottom of dial. Dial number scale position: pointing between 2 and 2.5, closer to 2.2, Clock position: approximately 2:40 o'clock, Degrees: 80\u00b0 (pointing RIGHT, slightly upward), Verification: Hand is pointing RIGHT-UP \u2713. Dial reading: 80/3600 = 0.022 m\u00b3. Total: 2271.422 m\u00b3. Image is slightly blurry making the exact black digit and dial position difficult to read with full certainty, but measurements are within expected range.",
