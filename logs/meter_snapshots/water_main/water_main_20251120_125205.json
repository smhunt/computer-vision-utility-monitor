    "notes": "Meter orientation check: BADGER METER text at top, digital display readable left-to-right. White digits (5 digits on left): 0 2 2 7 1 = 2271 m\u00b3. Black digit (single digit on right, separated): 2 = 0.2 m\u00b3. Red dial analysis: Dial orientation: '0' mark at top of dial, '5' mark at bottom of dial. Dial number scale position: pointing between 4.5 and 5, approximately 4.7 on dial face. Clock position: approximately 5.5 o'clock. Degrees: 169\u00b0 (pointing DOWN, slightly before 6 o'clock position). Verification: Hand is pointing DOWN-RIGHT, approaching bottom of dial \u2713. Dial reading: 169/3600 = 0.047 m\u00b3. Total: 2271.247 m\u00b3. Note: Image is slightly blurry which affects precise dial reading accuracy, but all digital components are clearly visible.",
