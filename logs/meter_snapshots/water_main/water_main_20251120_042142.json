    "notes": "Odometer wheels clearly show 02271.0. The rightmost wheel (tenths) displays a '0', with a slight sliver of '1' visible at the very top, indicating it has just rolled over to 0. The red needle on the circular dial is pointing at the second small tick mark after 0.04, which corresponds to 0.044. According to the '0.01 resolution' rule, this is rounded to 0.04 for the dial_value. The needle angle is calculated based on its precise position (0.044).",
