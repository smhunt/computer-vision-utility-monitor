    "notes": "The odometer wheels clearly show 02271.0. The rightmost wheel (tenths place) is showing '0' but is slightly advanced towards '1'. The red needle on the circular dial is positioned between the 0.04 and 0.05 marks. It appears to be approximately two-thirds of the way from 0.04 towards 0.05, which is 0.0466... When rounded to the specified 0.01 resolution, this becomes 0.05. The angle is calculated based on this interpolated position (4.66 / 10 * 360 = 168 degrees).",
