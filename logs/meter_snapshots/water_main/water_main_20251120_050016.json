    "notes": "Odometer wheels clearly show 2271.0. The red needle on the dial is pointing directly at the fourth minor tick mark after 0.03. With 4 minor ticks between 0.01 increments, each tick represents 0.002. Thus, the needle indicates 0.03 + (4 * 0.002) = 0.038. Following the rule to interpolate to 0.01 resolution, 0.038 rounds to 0.04. The needle angle is calculated based on 0.00 on the dial being 0 degrees, and the dial increasing clockwise, with 10 major divisions (0.00-0.09), making each division 36 degrees. 3.8 divisions * 36 degrees/division = 136.8 degrees.",
