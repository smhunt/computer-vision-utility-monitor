    "notes": "Odometer wheels read 02271.1, which is 2271.1 m\u00b3. The small red pointer is between 0.03 and 0.04 on the circular dial. It appears to be approximately at 0.038. Following the rule to interpolate to 'one decimal tick (0.01 resolution)', and since 0.038 is closer to 0.04 than 0.03, the dial value is 0.04. The total reading is 2271.1 + 0.04 = 2271.14 m\u00b3. The needle angle is calculated based on its precise position (0.038), with 0.00 at 0 degrees (12 o'clock) and each 0.01 increment being 36 degrees (3.8 * 36 = 136.8 degrees).",
