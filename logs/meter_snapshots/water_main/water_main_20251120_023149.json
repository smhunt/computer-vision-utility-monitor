    "notes": "Odometer wheels clearly display 02271.0. The red needle points precisely to the 3rd small tick mark after 0.04. Given each major division (0.01) has 5 small ticks, each tick is 0.002. Thus, the needle is at 0.04 + (3 * 0.002) = 0.046. Rounding to 0.01 resolution, 0.046 becomes 0.05. The needle angle is calculated assuming 0.00 (implied at 12 o'clock) is 0 degrees, and the dial progresses clockwise, with each 0.01 increment representing 36 degrees.",
