The four bright spots appear to be LED reflections rather than part of the reading. Recommend retaking image with better lighting for accurate reading.",

      "notes": "Image is too dark and unclear to reliably read either the digital display or the analog dial. The infrared/night vision lighting creates reflections that obscure the digital readout, and the dial markings and needle position cannot be determined. Better lighting conditions or a different camera mode would be needed for accurate meter reading.",
